# Untitled Plane Game Unity

A second take on making a small replica of LUFTRAUSERS but this time in Unity. 
Took me around 4-5 weeks of spare time to make, but I think it was worth it. At least for the first Unity project that is.

This repository includes both source project and a playable Windows (64 bit) version.

# Features (compared to previous C++ version)

- More polish and small details in general, like effects, sounds, menu, score/combos/highscore system and so on
- Better enemy variety, which brings most of the LUFTRAUSERS enemies (except for the blimp and submarines)

# Additional stuff used

- Unity ProBuilder for all of the plane/ship models
- Bfxr application for generating all of the game sounds

# Media
